# friendfeed-backup
A backup of my friendfeed account.

I've been using Friendfeed since the beginning of 2008. Unfortunately,
Friendfeed didn't age very well, and it was announced that it will shut down in
April 2015. This repository is the (possible, unfortunately many things are
getting lost in the process) backup of my Friendfeed presence.
