{"body":"So, more than 10 years after, I'll be returning to mp3.com - it seems. Curious to see how things turned out: while the good part of mp3.com was lost, the &quot;meh&quot; parts were split in half. One went to garageband.com -&gt; ilike -&gt; myspace, the other kept being mp3.com and is now closer and closer to last.fm....","commands":["comment","edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"url":"http://friendfeed.com/mindboosternoori/cf879235/so-more-than-10-years-after-i-ll-be-returning-to","comments":[{"date":"2011-06-08T18:00:08Z","body":"Also curious is the fact that both MySpace and Last.fm used to be better than they are today. Alternatives came and went. Trends changed. Nowadays the trend is the &quot;music cloud&quot;. Meh. So many opportunities lost. If there was a nowadays service doing what some services were doing more than 10 years ago, with today's technology, we would finally have the place music deserves on the internet. Instead, we have good ideas being buried, &quot;investments&quot; made in bad ideas, and we keep feeding those stalling us (yes, I'm looking at you RIAA). Some people saw &quot;the future&quot; in icloud's announcement, I see only an huge mistake. See how much money Apple had to give RIAA labels already. And see how much of that went to the artists. You're being ripped off. We're being ripped off. And &quot;innovation&quot; just keeps on... going backwards.","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/cf879235ea75452a8aa89c77065d3948/c/f408e50dd61e4c738ce6b753358e7965","dateFriendly":"June 08, 2011 at 18:00"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-06-08T20:56:31Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"June 08, 2011 at 20:56"}],"date":"2011-06-08T17:54:55Z","id":"e/cf879235ea75452a8aa89c77065d3948","name":"cf879235","dateFriendly":"June 08, 2011 at 17:54"}
