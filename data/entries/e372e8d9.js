After roughly 13 years with nearly the same design, the layout and design of many of the websites run by Debian changed together with today's release of Debian Squeeze. Debian's main website and its wiki, lists archive, blog aggregator planet and package information system now have a consistent new layout. The new layout is meant to give Debian's web presence a cleaner and more modern look as well as making the web pages easier to use and navigate.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-02-06T01:02:33Z","id":"e/e372e8d9455f412b9fa2fe8eddd0e6b6/c/6377ddb8ab0f4ff1971ddc3375c33b91","dateFriendly":"February 06, 2011 at 01:02"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-02-06T01:03:46Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"February 06, 2011 at 01:03"},{"date":"2011-02-06T01:02:38Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"February 06, 2011 at 01:02"}],"date":"2011-02-06T01:02:33Z","id":"e/e372e8d9455f412b9fa2fe8eddd0e6b6","name":"e372e8d9","dateFriendly":"February 06, 2011 at 01:02"}
