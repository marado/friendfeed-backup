Drawing opon their wide musical tastes from ethnic to hard rock and from blues to electronic music and experience of folklore expeditions and touring and traveling in Ukraine, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England, Dark Patrick have developed their own unique style which brings together the music of various ethnic traditions, but most promenantly Ukrainian and Irish, which they deliver to audiences with such force, fullness and extravagance that it is hard to believe that there are only two people on stage.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-01-17T03:10:37Z","id":"e/5e2014b1ccb844329e1cff391f871974/c/f8b6aeb525ea47faaa65ee6cf931d0a8","dateFriendly":"January 17, 2010 at 03:10"}],"likes":[{"date":"2010-01-17T10:15:46Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"January 17, 2010 at 10:15"},{"date":"2010-01-17T03:18:52Z","from":{"commands":["subscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"vcorreia","name":"Vitor Correia"},"dateFriendly":"January 17, 2010 at 03:18"}],"date":"2010-01-17T03:10:37Z","id":"e/5e2014b1ccb844329e1cff391f871974","name":"5e2014b1","dateFriendly":"January 17, 2010 at 03:10"}
