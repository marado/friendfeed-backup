The development increases the risk that the attack vector, already used by the highly sophisticated Stuxnet Trojan to attack Scada control systems, will be applied against a wider range of vulnerable systems.  All versions of Windows are potentially vulnerable to the exploit.  Just viewing the contents of an infected USB stick is enough to get pwned, even on systems where Windows Autoplay is disabled. Maliciously-crafted Windows shortcut (.lnk) files might also to be able to push malicious code through other attack routes left open by the vulnerability, such as Windows shares.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-07-20T13:30:36Z","id":"e/78572a9fb71b476bbcf3ca817fcfd40c/c/054dce3345ad43cd8b27c663caaec3fb","dateFriendly":"July 20, 2010 at 13:30"},{"date":"2010-07-20T13:47:42Z","body":"Exploitation of this vulnerability through apps and games cracks I sense.","commands":["delete"],"from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"id":"e/78572a9fb71b476bbcf3ca817fcfd40c/c/77c2cf0180434a408ee0e330aaed3d90","dateFriendly":"July 20, 2010 at 13:47"}],"likes":[{"date":"2010-07-20T15:53:40Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"July 20, 2010 at 15:53"},{"date":"2010-07-20T13:51:16Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"July 20, 2010 at 13:51"},{"date":"2010-07-20T13:46:43Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"July 20, 2010 at 13:46"}],"date":"2010-07-20T13:30:36Z","id":"e/78572a9fb71b476bbcf3ca817fcfd40c","name":"78572a9f","dateFriendly":"July 20, 2010 at 13:30"}
