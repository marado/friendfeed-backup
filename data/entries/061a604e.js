For now, you can still find it online, so you can listen and reach your own fair use conclusions. The song is obviously transformative, and it's hard to imagine it as a substitute for the originals.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-01-17T03:24:52Z","id":"e/061a604ec5bc4390803cb2985dd87d3f/c/880ce7f3358b412d843d3c0958009be3","dateFriendly":"January 17, 2010 at 03:24"}],"date":"2010-01-17T03:24:52Z","id":"e/061a604ec5bc4390803cb2985dd87d3f","name":"061a604e","dateFriendly":"January 17, 2010 at 03:24","likes":[]}
