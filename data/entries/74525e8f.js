Obviously we'll never know what great books have been lost to time, but we have clues on some of them, and what those clues tell us is mind-boggling, and a little bit depressing. If you could make a library out of just books that didn't survive, you'd have a collection of some of the best freaking books ever written.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-01-22T00:14:31Z","id":"e/74525e8f17e848a7a5a6a1a7004ce61b/c/8e4eee3bd82649dea75d80a2a227f6e5","dateFriendly":"January 22, 2010 at 00:14"},{"date":"2010-01-22T00:14:48Z","body":"Awesome article, made my day.","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/74525e8f17e848a7a5a6a1a7004ce61b/c/0490ba4bae8a402590fca636eb389490","dateFriendly":"January 22, 2010 at 00:14"}],"likes":[{"date":"2010-01-22T00:23:21Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"ovigia","name":"ovigia"},"dateFriendly":"January 22, 2010 at 00:23"}],"date":"2010-01-22T00:14:31Z","id":"e/74525e8f17e848a7a5a6a1a7004ce61b","name":"74525e8f","dateFriendly":"January 22, 2010 at 00:14"}
