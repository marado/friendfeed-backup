I don't have the numbers, but I wouldn't think that Continente number of employees is dropping, on the contrary. Technology and innovation make *changes*. I remember doing a study 10 years ago or so regarding the new cool tech stuff being used in Post offices. Lots of people were crying, those damn machines would take people's jobs away. Visiting a post office distribution center nowadays is... cool. Everyone uses the &quot;new technology&quot; and loves them. Oh, and they're still working there, of course.","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/d413620bc8b84b2b9817f06fe67801f8/c/82ac7e4bcc354f98b3b6f071fcf83000","dateFriendly":"July 08, 2011 at 22:55"}],"date":"2011-07-08T20:40:47Z","id":"e/d413620bc8b84b2b9817f06fe67801f8","name":"d413620b","dateFriendly":"July 08, 2011 at 20:40","likes":[]}
