No, &quot;Whom The Moon A Nightsong Sings&quot; is a two-CD collection with a playing time of over 100 minutes that unites all the main players and the most promising newcomers of a nameless genre that is defined by (mostly) acoustic musical settings of nature's sceneries and impressions, or of personal sentiments mirrored in nature. This profound respect and a deeply romantic magical and mystical perception of nature are the common denominator of all the featured artists and the thematic foundation of their contributions. The fact that nearly all of the songs included here are either exclusive to this project or rare tracks that aren't otherwise available anymore serves to emphasize the extraordinary character of this release.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-09-17T11:04:22Z","id":"e/985db1cf7222424c9eca71ea0b532987/c/faf5241eb9a941049114494cd31df3c7","dateFriendly":"September 17, 2010 at 11:04"}],"date":"2010-09-17T11:04:22Z","id":"e/985db1cf7222424c9eca71ea0b532987","name":"985db1cf","dateFriendly":"September 17, 2010 at 11:04","likes":[]}
