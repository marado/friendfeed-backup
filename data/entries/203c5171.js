Having already sold over 50 million records worldwide, Cooking Vinyl overcame fierce competition from several labels in the U.S. and U.K., both major and independent, to release what will be MARILYN MANSON's eighth studio album.  The global deal will see the album issued via MARILYN MANSON's own label — Hell, etc. — in a joint venture between Cooking Vinyl, with the album slated for release in 2011.  After parting ways with Interscope Records, the new partnership with Cooking Vinyl gives MARILYN MANSON an unprecedented degree of creative control. The new setup will see the artist take charge of delivering the completed, mastered album and Cooking Vinyl handling worldwide distribution, marketing and promotion.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-11-09T10:34:49Z","id":"e/203c51718138428d85bbbe695a48c6d5/c/e99a085734574c439cce4eb3188783e6","dateFriendly":"November 09, 2010 at 10:34"}],"date":"2010-11-09T10:34:49Z","id":"e/203c51718138428d85bbbe695a48c6d5","name":"203c5171","dateFriendly":"November 09, 2010 at 10:34","likes":[]}
