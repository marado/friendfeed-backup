To some it is all about a slick, symmetrical surface, an immaculate appearance. Others find beauty in moments of truthfulness when they recognize themselves in their counterparts.  On their iD.EOLOGY debut Tracing Arcs combine both aspects into a thrilling aesthetic overall experience. As soon as the first notes hit your ears, a film noir starts rolling in your head. Classy triphop beats, elaborate jazz-chords and deep upright basses skillfully sketch out a closed-off world in subtle shades of black.
