There is a person out there, who thinks using a random name, mail address and twitter account could fool me into thinking that’s a new, yet unknown, person to me. Well, I am not stupid, sorry. When you comment on my blog, your IP-address is logged, when I approve the comment, I often look at the reverse DNS and the whois entry of that IP-address (sorry, I AM paranoid). I even might check my webserver logs (or Piwik) where did you come from (Google etc), writing “accidentally” in your comment does not help :) Also, if you are trying to fool me, don’t use your own computer, running Windows 7 and Firefox which I installed. Oh, and probably do not use your home line which I used to login into my admin-area using my unique Chromium ;)&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-02-15T11:47:34Z","id":"e/2a2eb68f29f347bf94490166cf5b802b/c/0ccbb497cbe74049b616f070e655026d","dateFriendly":"February 15, 2011 at 11:47"}],"date":"2011-02-15T11:47:34Z","id":"e/2a2eb68f29f347bf94490166cf5b802b","name":"2a2eb68f","dateFriendly":"February 15, 2011 at 11:47","likes":[]}
