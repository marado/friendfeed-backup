The original key is destroyed, and we are left with an RSA key whose private key is known only on-chip on the TPM.  This means that, short of a vulnerability in the TPM, in order to use this RSA key, the private key operation must happen on this specific TPM, so mechanisms that use it are better protected against brute-force attacks.  Furthermore, as current TPMs can take around half a second for a private key operation, even attacks which use the TPM are effectively rate limited.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/825852c1f8af453fa5f1d40482759336/c/2f46fe8aa6d840e18f395b7b498deb71","dateFriendly":"May 12, 2011 at 16:28"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-05-12T18:41:46Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"May 12, 2011 at 18:41"},{"date":"2011-05-12T16:21:48Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"ovigia","name":"ovigia"},"dateFriendly":"May 12, 2011 at 16:21"},{"date":"2011-05-12T16:19:12Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"May 12, 2011 at 16:19"}],"date":"2011-05-12T16:18:21Z","id":"e/825852c1f8af453fa5f1d40482759336","name":"825852c1","dateFriendly":"May 12, 2011 at 16:18"}
