At this very point of time in which we live, computers and internet together have made ‘sharing’ information as trivial as hitting keys and clicking few buttons. Why should anybody even try to suppress this when it(sharing) is good and healthy for the human community. I have been observing this phenomenon and questioning myself about it off late. Today I thought I should write my thoughts about it as the ‘Day Against DRM’ is fast approaching, 4th of May 2011 to be precise. Yes it is DRM, expanded as Digital Restrictions management. The ramble that is going to follow, as usual, should not be taken as facts but as an expression and perception of an individual (i.e myself) who was made aware of DRM about a little more than a year ago. I have not yet articulated myself with DRM so I might be vague and quite clumsy with my expression.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-05-04T14:26:29Z","id":"e/af7f17b052974183b9bbe8190dd6adde/c/8cd10de661eb43f79d214fae1d4eab7a","dateFriendly":"May 04, 2011 at 14:26"}],"date":"2011-05-04T14:26:29Z","id":"e/af7f17b052974183b9bbe8190dd6adde","name":"af7f17b0","dateFriendly":"May 04, 2011 at 14:26","likes":[]}
