Why is that bad? Well, basically because it’s kind of a step backwards in the digital world for users: it’s been hard to make sure all devices can read all formats (it’s not exactly achieved though, but let’s say we’re getting “close enough”), it’s been a pain to make lots of Windows software work under Linux (Wine…), etc. And DRM are aiming at doing just the opposite: you can install that only X times, you need a connection to the Internet all the time during which you play that single player game, you need a Live! account to save your progress in that same offline game, etc. Although the latest might be practical were it optional, all these things are degrading the user experience. And worse: they have a cost, that you pay too. When you buy a device or a media impaired by DRM you pay more for a worse user experience, and you feed the system.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-05-04T14:27:15Z","id":"e/bf90a0dff4664812b7423d2e0e7d0552/c/d0f6204d14a44732b7ed6a1d8a7d2ef3","dateFriendly":"May 04, 2011 at 14:27"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-05-04T14:33:33Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"May 04, 2011 at 14:33"},{"date":"2011-05-04T14:30:45Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"May 04, 2011 at 14:30"}],"date":"2011-05-04T14:27:15Z","id":"e/bf90a0dff4664812b7423d2e0e7d0552","name":"bf90a0df","dateFriendly":"May 04, 2011 at 14:27"}
