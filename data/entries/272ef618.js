{"body":"Damn me if DVAR isn't one of the greatest musical acts of our times. They have superb compositions, a blend of dozens of styles and influences, originality enough to have defined an whole new musical style, and they're fun as hell.

Geniouses.","commands":["comment","edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://www.fftogo.com/","name":"fftogo"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"url":"http://friendfeed.com/mindboosternoori/272ef618/damn-me-if-dvar-isn-t-one-of-greatest-musical-acts","likes":[{"date":"2010-05-18T06:01:46Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"May 18, 2010 at 06:01"}],"date":"2010-05-17T23:05:05Z","id":"e/272ef618162c4ff888fba0466dc3614c","name":"272ef618","dateFriendly":"May 17, 2010 at 23:05","comments":[]}
