The researchers say that modulation speeds of up to 500GHz are theoretically possible. According to the research, due to the high modulation speeds, a graphene modulator can transmit a huge amount of data using spectral bandwidth that conventional modulators can only dream of. Professor Xiang Zhang, in an attempt to boil his group's new findings into consumer-speak, puts it this way: 'If graphene modulators can actually operate at 500GHz, we could soon see networks that are capable of petabit or exabit transmission speeds, rather than megabits and gigabits.'&quot;&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-05-11T09:42:16Z","id":"e/a73cb12b13e94252b7269b22586c439e/c/183d3aec494c497c8120a3fdaa82e0a4","dateFriendly":"May 11, 2011 at 09:42"}],"date":"2011-05-11T09:42:16Z","id":"e/a73cb12b13e94252b7269b22586c439e","name":"a73cb12b","dateFriendly":"May 11, 2011 at 09:42","likes":[]}
