The PadFone and its corresponding tablet shell and keyboard dock, will be up for pre-order in Taiwan starting tomorrow, going on sale April 20th. On its own, the Snapdragon S4-powered 1.5GHz dual-core phone is priced at NT$17,990 (US$610), while the tablet set -- including that curious Bluetooth headset / stylus -- will set you back NT$24,980 (around US$850). If you're thinking keyboard add-ons are all the rage, expect to pay around NT$28,901 (US$980). Need more of an excuse to step into pre-order territory? Well, ASUS is offering up an extra battery for those that do. While we wait for some global roll-out details, you can remind yourself of what to expect in our hands-on from MWC.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2012-04-12T09:09:16Z","id":"e/795761bda90a4837a8cdca0eabec2bd6/c/4effe0257e8749918234e234f4c5be70","dateFriendly":"April 12, 2012 at 09:09"},{"date":"2012-04-12T09:09:37Z","body":"20th April, in Taiwan","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/795761bda90a4837a8cdca0eabec2bd6/c/d49fbc6622204dc0a4bc38df09cecd53","dateFriendly":"April 12, 2012 at 09:09"}],"likes":[{"date":"2012-04-12T10:15:39Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"April 12, 2012 at 10:15"}],"date":"2012-04-12T09:09:16Z","id":"e/795761bda90a4837a8cdca0eabec2bd6","name":"795761bd","dateFriendly":"April 12, 2012 at 09:09"}
