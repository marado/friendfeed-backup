With dashes of Kubrick, Vonnegut, and Dick, but a flavor entirely his own, Fassbinder tells the noir-spiked tale of reluctant action hero Fred Stiller (Klaus Lowitsch), a cybernetics engineer who uncovers a massive corporate and governmental conspiracy. At risk? Our entire (virtual) reality as we know it. This long unseen three-and-a-half-hour labyrinth is a satiric and surreal look at the weird world of tomorrow from one of cinema’s kinkiest geniuses.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-11-20T01:49:41Z","id":"e/a34e214f3dbf4e1bbdcb5d09611d91cb/c/02c5541ef94946be859e8a2fb1a50f11","dateFriendly":"November 20, 2011 at 01:49"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-11-20T11:23:44Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"November 20, 2011 at 11:23"},{"date":"2011-11-20T10:42:24Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"cisg","name":"Carla Graça"},"dateFriendly":"November 20, 2011 at 10:42"},{"date":"2011-11-20T04:52:38Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"November 20, 2011 at 04:52"},{"date":"2011-11-20T02:54:40Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"paulasimoes","name":"paula simoes ☃"},"dateFriendly":"November 20, 2011 at 02:54"}],"date":"2011-11-20T01:49:41Z","id":"e/a34e214f3dbf4e1bbdcb5d09611d91cb","name":"a34e214f","dateFriendly":"November 20, 2011 at 01:49"}
