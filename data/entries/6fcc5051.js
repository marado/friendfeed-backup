RemoteBox allows you to administer an installation of VirtualBox residing on another machine such as a server, as if it was installed locally. You can also interact with the displays of the guests.

A summary of some of the features of RemoteBox are listed below.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2012-06-04T10:53:14Z","id":"e/6fcc50513f1e41c78cbd09e0d663a0d6/c/f3b978d6d1714c83b25a56d641409ce7","dateFriendly":"June 04, 2012 at 10:53"}],"date":"2012-06-04T10:53:14Z","id":"e/6fcc50513f1e41c78cbd09e0d663a0d6","name":"6fcc5051","dateFriendly":"June 04, 2012 at 10:53","likes":[]}
