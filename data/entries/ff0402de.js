{"body":"Sentences have a beginning and an end. Spreading four ellipses randomly on the &quot;sentence&quot; you're building doesn't give you any excuse to not having the beginning and the end. If you don't even know how to write a sentence (or something similar to it), you can't expect your e-mails to be taken seriously.
