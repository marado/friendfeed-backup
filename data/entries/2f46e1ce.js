All devices that support HDCP, like Blu-ray players, set-top boxes and displays with HDMI inputs, have their own set of keys to encrypt and decrypt protected data and if keys for a particular device are compromised, they can be revoked by content released in the future which will then refuse to play. Now, posts have been floating around on Twitter about a supposed &quot;master key&quot; which renders that protection unusable since it allows anyone to create their own source and sink keys.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-09-14T14:30:39Z","id":"e/2f46e1ce77634dee978867b5196d2684/c/a975cf7f033e4eec82cb00cd9ce89c61","dateFriendly":"September 14, 2010 at 14:30"}],"date":"2010-09-14T14:30:39Z","id":"e/2f46e1ce77634dee978867b5196d2684","name":"2f46e1ce","dateFriendly":"September 14, 2010 at 14:30","likes":[]}
