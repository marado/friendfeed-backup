As a (very) small company, we have to outsource quite a lot of stages of development. We believe in the power of the community, so instead of investing our limited funds in paying our vendors to port a new version of Android or feature and having to wait months for a decent result, we prefer to invest it in the community. In the short-term it's more expensive, but it's both more satisfactory and, believe me, it's impressive what a guy like Ricardo Cerqueira (who is like our &quot;Cyanogen&quot;) or any other member of our community can do in a couple of weeks even without the source code ;)&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-07-21T13:49:30Z","id":"e/31992e522b3b4f3c9feba62d8dce532c/c/6d6bf603f3194b689b15149fc05226c0","dateFriendly":"July 21, 2010 at 13:49"}],"likes":[{"date":"2010-07-21T13:57:00Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"July 21, 2010 at 13:57"},{"date":"2010-07-21T13:56:04Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"July 21, 2010 at 13:56"}],"date":"2010-07-21T13:49:30Z","id":"e/31992e522b3b4f3c9feba62d8dce532c","name":"31992e52","dateFriendly":"July 21, 2010 at 13:49"}
