Surprise - the BSA is not happy about this.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-03-08T18:56:43Z","id":"e/500774a53b2446288be2ef85247e4d58/c/8d2009b2dab34c09b9c1773cb418320b","dateFriendly":"March 08, 2011 at 18:56"},{"date":"2011-03-08T18:57:01Z","body":"Thing is, this isn't good news at all.","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/500774a53b2446288be2ef85247e4d58/c/64f9e5850cc640938f1d5bffe6bb2148","dateFriendly":"March 08, 2011 at 18:57"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-03-08T19:10:38Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"March 08, 2011 at 19:10"},{"date":"2011-03-08T19:06:02Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"ovigia","name":"ovigia"},"dateFriendly":"March 08, 2011 at 19:06"},{"date":"2011-03-08T19:05:41Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"March 08, 2011 at 19:05"}],"date":"2011-03-08T18:56:43Z","id":"e/500774a53b2446288be2ef85247e4d58","name":"500774a5","dateFriendly":"March 08, 2011 at 18:56"}
