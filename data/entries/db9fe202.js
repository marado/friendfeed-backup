She sent a booking request which was really just a veiled attempt to have some sort of personal contact with me. This woman from Austin, Texas quickly started to seem weird when she started to talk about her involvement in cults and began sending me really personal information that seemed out of place in a booking request. She was keen to say she was a published author, but a 5-minute search proved her book was really just a &quot;vanity pressing&quot;. In any case, when I realized she was not a legitimate booking agent but rather a love-struck, crazed fan, I politely declined to do the show. And then the truth came out and the love letters began. And when I politely asked her to stop emailing me, the hate mail began as well, schizophrenically interspersed with more love letters. And they just got weirder and weirder. Now she claims I married her when I she was seventeen. I think I'd remember that! I'd like to point out again for the record that I do not know this woman! Well, anyway, normally, I wouldn't publish emails people send me, but since I asked her to stop and she didn't care to, I'm going to guess she wants the attention and won't mind of I share them with you. Perhaps this will give you all a brief window into what we musicians, actors and artists have to deal with from time to time. Honestly, sometimes it makes you want to stop reading emails....&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2009-12-17T12:09:51Z","id":"e/db9fe202f03c43aa9bdc074a92daaa2c/c/fd59d47b6a064512b4be463590d9f765","dateFriendly":"December 17, 2009 at 12:09"}],"likes":[{"date":"2009-12-17T14:30:07Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"December 17, 2009 at 14:30"}],"date":"2009-12-17T12:09:51Z","id":"e/db9fe202f03c43aa9bdc074a92daaa2c","name":"db9fe202","dateFriendly":"December 17, 2009 at 12:09"}
