Each track has a temporal development similar to the form of a traditional composition, thru an initial state of equilibrium, followed by a disbalance that ends in a new equilibrium. At the same time each piece can be listened in a loop as an atemporal non-evolutive sonic background. Each track is manipulated in real time, I played on the sound of water or fire like on a musical instrument, borrowing the nuances and expression learned from playing piano.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-04-07T13:22:01Z","id":"e/2272687662a7492087f26e0f8e9d7b5a/c/4c0f3798ea534a3eaead3e4febc7fd92","dateFriendly":"April 07, 2010 at 13:22"}],"date":"2010-04-07T13:22:01Z","id":"e/2272687662a7492087f26e0f8e9d7b5a","name":"22726876","dateFriendly":"April 07, 2010 at 13:22","likes":[]}
