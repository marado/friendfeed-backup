It examines how young people construct their identities in various social contexts: social, fantasy, role-playing; and for various social purposes: leadership, learning, power, rebellion and romance. It explores the ways youth are deploying both visual and literary cues to develop a full sense of presence online and to effectively communicate with their peers. Using methods of textual, visual, and socio-psychological analysis, this book illuminates the ways in which young people are making sense of their own identities and their place within broader communities.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-04-28T18:17:29Z","id":"e/95a74c18f392495b8af1f41e394db2ee/c/7681fbff5c0144ca9be89884fcd4cadf","dateFriendly":"April 28, 2010 at 18:17"}],"date":"2010-04-28T18:17:29Z","id":"e/95a74c18f392495b8af1f41e394db2ee","name":"95a74c18","dateFriendly":"April 28, 2010 at 18:17","likes":[]}
