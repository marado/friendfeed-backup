For the last decade I’ve been thinking about where the real money is in digital music and it’s in search and discovery. The trick is to monetize that activity. If I were one of these dopey label heads, I’d have gone to Google (in fact every search engine) years ago and offered my entire catalog for unlimited streaming and playlist sharing for 70% of the search revenue. If someone wanted portability charge 49 or 59 cents per download. Google knows exactly what the numbers are and could predict the search revenues almost to the penny, thus almost totally eliminating any risk on the part of the labels and I’d be willing to bet that those revenues would amount to billions. After all, search is how Google became a multi-billion dollar company. Don’t demand ridiculous advances; revenues would be flowing in instantly and paid quickly.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-01-05T16:15:23Z","id":"e/d289d3344aff4606904e06a990389f63/c/6b74409de6904ab9886ba709623be594","dateFriendly":"January 05, 2011 at 16:15"}],"date":"2011-01-05T16:15:23Z","id":"e/d289d3344aff4606904e06a990389f63","name":"d289d334","dateFriendly":"January 05, 2011 at 16:15","likes":[]}
