Spell 336' essentially the same name as the band, is a somewhat dreamy/shoe-gaze sound. Their cut pop style is dressed in melodic guitars and Morrissey-esque vocals, but you won't find any constantly shifting time signatures, or any other &quot;musical feats but this music is impressive.  For me the tracks have an interesting atmosphere that surrounds the sound and the vocals have a haunting mysterioso to accompany. This is pop music for the fall, for rainy days, for cloudy skies...In general this is music to make you relax.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-05-25T11:26:21Z","id":"e/f80ce4f28138428aa5bbd359d76911de/c/7f37f2af15884c8e9985929508e297c0","dateFriendly":"May 25, 2010 at 11:26"}],"date":"2010-05-25T11:26:21Z","id":"e/f80ce4f28138428aa5bbd359d76911de","name":"f80ce4f2","dateFriendly":"May 25, 2010 at 11:26","likes":[]}
