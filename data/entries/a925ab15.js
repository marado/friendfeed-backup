The fact that the screen is always in landscape might be a problem if there are any applications that only work in portrait mode (theoretically, I don't know any with that behaviour, just the opposite). The aspect ratio is correct and the resolution standard, so there should be no problems with that. Of course that when you don't have much screen space you can't have as many widgets and icons in each virtual desktop, but I don't think that would be a problem (for me, at least)... Overall, and at the first glance, it seems a pretty nice terminal (I'm actually surprised), specially if you take into account its price.","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/a925ab15d5634fbbb1667a0cb19aab51/c/2bde496957f04fc4a7772081bd31ba5c","dateFriendly":"April 21, 2011 at 17:04"},{"body":"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://friendfeed.com/iphone/mindboosternoori/f62da36f/brincar-um-optimus-pequim-estou-impressionado\" title=\"https://friendfeed.com/iphone/mindboosternoori/f62da36f/brincar-um-optimus-pequim-estou-impressionado\">https://friendfeed.com/iphone...</a>","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/about/tools","name":"Android"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-04-28T19:01:29Z","id":"e/a925ab15d5634fbbb1667a0cb19aab51/c/93c3f6cfa7c0478fbf45f9d02e7d3d71","dateFriendly":"April 28, 2011 at 19:01"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-04-21T16:50:33Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"joaopsmartins","name":"João Martins"},"dateFriendly":"April 21, 2011 at 16:50"},{"date":"2011-04-21T16:48:14Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"April 21, 2011 at 16:48"}],"date":"2011-04-21T16:42:02Z","id":"e/a925ab15d5634fbbb1667a0cb19aab51","name":"a925ab15","dateFriendly":"April 21, 2011 at 16:42"}
