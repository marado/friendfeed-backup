Probably what will happen will be better and more luxury editions for the ones that have the pleasure of owning and purchasing a musical object. I’m really sorry that people are used to have everything for free without valuing the work of the artists. Although I reckon this is a double faced situation, its becoming common to see younger people and non DJs buying vinyl, opposite to the cd or the digital mp3. The vinyl is difficult to copy to other formats with the same sound quality and aesthetically in terms of artwork it’s much more interesting, I guess the value of the vinyl as a music object has increased.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-12-15T17:36:04Z","id":"e/5bdff9ef4d9d4ee2a21a450ab6d0d3c3/c/12415a7f404d4a2fa23eb619462ee017","dateFriendly":"December 15, 2010 at 17:36"}],"likes":[{"date":"2010-12-15T17:47:16Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"December 15, 2010 at 17:47"},{"date":"2010-12-15T17:45:45Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"December 15, 2010 at 17:45"}],"date":"2010-12-15T17:36:04Z","id":"e/5bdff9ef4d9d4ee2a21a450ab6d0d3c3","name":"5bdff9ef","dateFriendly":"December 15, 2010 at 17:36"}
