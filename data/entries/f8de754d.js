THANKS GUYS YOU ARE THE BEST &lt;3 so this project will go forward regardless of big money or &quot;impohhhrrrtant people&quot; involved in its making. you will have the opportunity of seeing me rendering in live spoken word the 14:20 piece which features a poem by Marguerite Duras, translated by me as &quot;IPSWICH - CÉSARÉE&quot;. in the end there is a live spoken word rendition of Allen Ginsberg's legendary poem HOWL in a live improv with Araguaney Leaf who comes from Spain to play here. it will be a great night and you all should be there. you are also encouraged to bring audio/video recorders to capture the live show. as for the jury dudes I should say, deserve to board a Revenge Airways airliner and crash against the Empire State Building.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-02-15T23:35:57Z","id":"e/f8de754d5b914be4bd5c28f22b5040ac/c/53659cdb6665480d95f3f243eea3d385","dateFriendly":"February 15, 2010 at 23:35"}],"date":"2010-02-15T23:35:57Z","id":"e/f8de754d5b914be4bd5c28f22b5040ac","name":"f8de754d","dateFriendly":"February 15, 2010 at 23:35","likes":[]}
