This isn’t a picket line demanding that HarperCollins acquiesce to our demands. This is a tactic. It feels unfamiliar because we never vote with our wallets. As consumers, we do this all the time. Groups organize boycotts to get companies to change their advertising or corporate policy and the two sides come to an agreement and then we can shop at Target again. As librarians, we don’t really have enough money to use it as a bargaining chip. But we’re trying it with this boycott. The demand isn’t to go back to the way things were, because that isn’t going to work for anyone. It’s to come together to find a new solution that will help us all.&quot;","commands":["delete"],"from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"paulasimoes","name":"paula simoes ☃"},"id":"e/8caf25059afc4f5ebfef9762c4d12f5c/c/a178def7e8e44a1198f0b01110ae1be4","dateFriendly":"March 02, 2011 at 21:33"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-03-02T22:01:15Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"March 02, 2011 at 22:01"},{"date":"2011-03-02T21:33:41Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"paulasimoes","name":"paula simoes ☃"},"dateFriendly":"March 02, 2011 at 21:33"}],"date":"2011-03-02T21:14:22Z","id":"e/8caf25059afc4f5ebfef9762c4d12f5c","name":"8caf2505","dateFriendly":"March 02, 2011 at 21:14"}
