As numerous experts (such as Rep. Rush Holt) have attempted, with futility, to explain, expanding the scope of raw intelligence data collected by our national security agencies invariably impedes rather than bolsters efforts to detect terrorist plots.  This is true for two reasons:  (1) eliminating strict content limits on what can be surveilled (along with enforcement safeguards, such as judicial warrants) means that government agents spend substantial time scrutinizing and sorting through communications and other information that have nothing to do with terrorism; and (2) increasing the quantity of what is collected makes it more difficult to find information relevant to actual terrorism plots.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-01-17T03:29:14Z","id":"e/ae8fbbb9fe114eeb848fb11662e37cf3/c/7539e280c65641ba8573d8700738d49f","dateFriendly":"January 17, 2010 at 03:29"}],"date":"2010-01-17T03:29:14Z","id":"e/ae8fbbb9fe114eeb848fb11662e37cf3","name":"ae8fbbb9","dateFriendly":"January 17, 2010 at 03:29","likes":[]}
