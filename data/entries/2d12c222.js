Some people in the US government are not happy about it and are putting political pressure on other countries (Sweden, France, UK, Australia) and companies (Amazon, Tableau, Paypal, EasyDNS) to discredit and now censor wikileaks. How is this different from what the Chinese communist party is doing to their citizens? The world has the right to a democracy. The world has a right to free speech. And the world has a right to demand transparency from the ones voted into office. It is argued that secrecy is required to handle diplomatic interests without jeopardizing the effort. Without honesty and transparency there is no diplomacy. The world is tired of high finance political corruption, fake sense of democracy, office seats won by public relations and marketing campaigns based on fake values and void promises, lack of privacy, censorship. We need transparency in our governments. We need wikileaks and other public services like it.  So what are we doing about it?&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-12-05T20:28:52Z","id":"e/2d12c2227427422c84bbbddf2a963fd2/c/dcb65386c8094b6e9fef9a0615ff0b62","dateFriendly":"December 05, 2010 at 20:28"}],"likes":[{"date":"2010-12-05T21:52:52Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"December 05, 2010 at 21:52"},{"date":"2010-12-05T21:24:34Z","from":{"commands":["subscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"nunomccorreia","name":"Nuno Miguel Correia"},"dateFriendly":"December 05, 2010 at 21:24"},{"date":"2010-12-05T20:45:29Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"December 05, 2010 at 20:45"},{"date":"2010-12-05T20:38:01Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"ovigia","name":"ovigia"},"dateFriendly":"December 05, 2010 at 20:38"},{"date":"2010-12-05T20:31:09Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"December 05, 2010 at 20:31"}],"date":"2010-12-05T20:28:52Z","id":"e/2d12c2227427422c84bbbddf2a963fd2","name":"2d12c222","dateFriendly":"December 05, 2010 at 20:28"}
