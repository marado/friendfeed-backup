An infected user can’t recognize that his money is being stolen, because he sees fake data on the banking web page based on the webinjects’ rules. (Autoloads bypass one-time password security checks.) The same functionality was tracked in the Carberp (Carberp Gang Evolution), Gataka (Win32/Gataka banking Trojan – Detailed analysis), Win32/Spy.Ranbyus (Win32/Spy.Ranbyus modifying Java code in RBS Ukraine systems) and Tinba malware families. Just for the record, ESET antimalware does detect all of these threats.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2013-02-25T14:11:35Z","id":"e/c5ce378216384462b7b1aeb0132c8845/c/444a40842062433e99398e72cd814a60","dateFriendly":"February 25, 2013 at 14:11"}],"likes":[{"date":"2013-02-25T23:04:54Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"February 25, 2013 at 23:04"}],"date":"2013-02-25T14:11:35Z","id":"e/c5ce378216384462b7b1aeb0132c8845","name":"c5ce3782","dateFriendly":"February 25, 2013 at 14:11"}
