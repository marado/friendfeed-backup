The press will inevitably write that EMI will be broken up and sold in pieces. So, let me say this as clearly as I can: Global Rights Management is the future, and it takes both parts of the business working together to achieve that future. I have no doubt that the best possible way to yield the highest value for EMI is to keep our businesses together in pursuit of our strategy. As we move forward that will become evident even to the most sceptical observer. This is why I have every confidence that EMI will remain EMI for a very, very long time to come.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-02-02T14:37:05Z","id":"e/fb8d0a79a1f54da7967ee375094e9ec8/c/17deb22575b24bb5844dd4075fa677d4","dateFriendly":"February 02, 2011 at 14:37"}],"date":"2011-02-02T14:37:05Z","id":"e/fb8d0a79a1f54da7967ee375094e9ec8","name":"fb8d0a79","dateFriendly":"February 02, 2011 at 14:37","likes":[]}
