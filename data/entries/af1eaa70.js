The new €78 billion loan will raise Portugal's public debt to 120% of its GDP. In the manner of the late, great financier Charles Ponzi, Portugal is borrowing money with which to pay off creditors. Not to worry, once it gets past this troublesome liquidity crisis, it will be able to borrow in international markets to repay the loans it is receiving from the IMF and its European partners, loans being used to repay other loans, with money it borrows from private-sector investors. If you don't get it, you get it.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-05-10T09:34:49Z","id":"e/af1eaa70d3df489682fca120c1e8efc9/c/8442f48d61b94955bda450f0ead39f62","dateFriendly":"May 10, 2011 at 09:34"},{"date":"2011-05-10T09:36:38Z","body":"&quot;The second difficult-to-understand part of the bailout scheme is that about 15% will be used to shore up the nation's undercapitalized banks. The troubled banks will be recapitalized with government money if they fail to raise enough capital in the market to bring their tier one capital ratio—the measure of a bank's solidity—to 9% this year and 10% by the end of 2012. The government will issue up to €35 billion of government-backed bonds if, as is highly likely, the private sector does not see investment in Portuguese banks as the investment opportunity of a lifetime. Why a guarantee from a government presiding over a heavily indebted, shrinking economy will encourage investors to make funds available to banks that have been on life support from the European Central Bank is not explained.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/af1eaa70d3df489682fca120c1e8efc9/c/ab926138d9e14a1f85fe726b9d6d310e","dateFriendly":"May 10, 2011 at 09:36"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-05-10T13:48:36Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"May 10, 2011 at 13:48"},{"date":"2011-05-10T10:27:03Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"remixtures","name":"Miguel Caetano"},"dateFriendly":"May 10, 2011 at 10:27"},{"date":"2011-05-10T10:03:38Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"paulasimoes","name":"paula simoes ☃"},"dateFriendly":"May 10, 2011 at 10:03"}],"date":"2011-05-10T09:34:49Z","id":"e/af1eaa70d3df489682fca120c1e8efc9","name":"af1eaa70","dateFriendly":"May 10, 2011 at 09:34"}
