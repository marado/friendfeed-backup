No IMEI problems, wireless works fine, etc. Apps seem more stable (Barcode Scanner doesn't constantly crash, Navigation no longer crashes when you change the angle of the phone). But unfortunately the proximity sensor is still broken (UV sensitive - you can't use your voicemail in the dark). Clearly that's a hardware issue with the Blaze. Be sure to back up your phone before continuing - the update will erase everything not stored on the SD card.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-09-08T14:06:15Z","id":"e/c1c1dbec624b48ffbab1a7e5c44d0bbe/c/99b4aff41db446e0b64a659ef5294ebd","dateFriendly":"September 08, 2010 at 14:06"},{"date":"2010-09-08T18:44:57Z","body":"Pretty stock Eclair, too, the only customizations I noticed were the TouchPal keyboard and the spring effect in the scrollable list edges.
