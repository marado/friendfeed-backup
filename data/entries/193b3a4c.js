Some kind of gift from the artists for us and from us to you, our dear listeners. On this compilation you'll find works of Eldar and their side-project Asbaar, Art of Empathy, Verney1826, Nosens, The Willow Landscape, Aevum Spiritus and Morpheus. It seems like darkest and most gothic-sounding release of Lomeanor. Enjoy.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-08-30T09:11:00Z","id":"e/193b3a4cf5d243789c27d6434c932bf6/c/078ed0a17585431585482a8031c2ef5b","dateFriendly":"August 30, 2010 at 09:11"}],"date":"2010-08-30T09:11:00Z","id":"e/193b3a4cf5d243789c27d6434c932bf6","name":"193b3a4c","dateFriendly":"August 30, 2010 at 09:11","likes":[]}
