Yes, you can look at Amazon’s changes and in theory you can make further improvements to code that could run on the Kindle. That would be awesome — except that Amazon has tivoized the Kindle, blocking your ability to put modified code back on your own device. Doing so requires circumventing part of their DRM system, which could earn you criminal prosecution under the DMCA. If Amazon were actually respecting its users, it would not prevent you from loading modified software onto your own device.
