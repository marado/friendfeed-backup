Although not easily lending itself to simple classification, it contains elements of avant-garde post-rock, experimental electronica, acoustic rock, and even varying strains of blues elements. Meanwhile, the vocals, while being mystically minded and cryptic, are far from being the typical 'statements of the genre' or 'predictably cliched' (which even the vanguards of the respective genres are slowly falling prey to). In short, if you are tired of listening to music that sounds as if it's listelessly staring at the floor, give this album a spin and shift your gaze upwards, to the endless ocean of stars.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-09-27T14:33:00Z","id":"e/8f651bb6282e44f4ac671387e415b15b/c/8c5f09edd9524f08a7213fc0074c7500","dateFriendly":"September 27, 2010 at 14:33"}],"date":"2010-09-27T14:33:00Z","id":"e/8f651bb6282e44f4ac671387e415b15b","name":"8f651bb6","dateFriendly":"September 27, 2010 at 14:33","likes":[]}
