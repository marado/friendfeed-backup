Nevertheless, they possibly come even closer to the philosophy of the project. The differences can immediately be seen in the prizes on offer: instead of a commercially-available Midi controller, we are developing a special one-off Midi controller, with the unmistakable Digitópia stamp. But more importantly, all the competitions reflect the idea of sharing with the community: from original Max/MSP or Pure Data patches distributed with open source licences, to new contributions of small musical gestures to freesound.org. It all culminates in a special competition which is full of potential: we will reward the most daring dream by making it come true!&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-01-13T09:42:49Z","id":"e/3783d5d0ed2448979b4faf167623e73b/c/8e2994fc39fa42bd90d77317e75104c3","dateFriendly":"January 13, 2010 at 09:42"}],"likes":[{"date":"2010-01-13T09:45:27Z","from":{"commands":["subscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"vmlemon","name":"Tyson Key"},"dateFriendly":"January 13, 2010 at 09:45"}],"date":"2010-01-13T09:42:49Z","id":"e/3783d5d0ed2448979b4faf167623e73b","name":"3783d5d0","dateFriendly":"January 13, 2010 at 09:42"}
