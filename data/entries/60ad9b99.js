This original piece will be auctioned to raise money for the defense fund of Damien Echols (who is on death row), Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley, Jr.—also known as the West Memphis Three —who were convicted for murdering three elementary school children in 1994. Since the horrific crimes, DNA from the crime scene and victims was tested by Bode, the country's most trusted crime lab, and none of it matches these three unjustly imprisoned men. For three weeks starting December 5, Judge David Laser will be holding an evidentiary hearing for the three men to review all post conviction evidence.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-07-04T22:35:40Z","id":"e/60ad9b99460b4700966d07dd1863574d/c/2232c62d46d14520b7feda8004293d0f","dateFriendly":"July 04, 2011 at 22:35"}],"date":"2011-07-04T22:35:40Z","id":"e/60ad9b99460b4700966d07dd1863574d","name":"60ad9b99","dateFriendly":"July 04, 2011 at 22:35","likes":[]}
