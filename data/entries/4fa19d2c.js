A non satisfied customer, who happens to be a well-know blogger and runs the social community of one of the Portuguese most used internet provider wrote some blog posts about a specific situation of a defective equipment bought at their shop and how the complaint hasn’t been solved to the outmost customer’s satisfaction on a direct approach. Ensitel didn’t appreciate the blog posts and asked her to delete them, which she denied. Ensitel then sued the customer and won on court (*). Almost two years later, the customer receives again a legal intimation to delete the posts from the blog. The situation is, since yesterday, widely spread on a social movement against the company and instead of being erased, the post are now being reposted all over.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2010-12-29T10:51:42Z","id":"e/4fa19d2c6c8a40759c6f8d8ef07abf76/c/49efe53d29d746ff9252785668d62a7d","dateFriendly":"December 29, 2010 at 10:51"}],"likes":[{"date":"2010-12-29T16:55:48Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"ovigia","name":"ovigia"},"dateFriendly":"December 29, 2010 at 16:55"},{"date":"2010-12-29T11:37:06Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"December 29, 2010 at 11:37"},{"date":"2010-12-29T11:20:00Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"December 29, 2010 at 11:20"}],"date":"2010-12-29T10:51:42Z","id":"e/4fa19d2c6c8a40759c6f8d8ef07abf76","name":"4fa19d2c","dateFriendly":"December 29, 2010 at 10:51"}
