HTTP fallbacks for BT also work (eg.  blizzard downloader for wow) and would basically resort to regular downloading and maybe get some help from BT on the way down.  In some ways I agree with you, and certainly about rapidshare, however, BT as distribution medium needs more support, not less.","commands":["delete"],"from":{"commands":["subscribe"],"type":"user","id":"projct","name":"mjc"},"id":"e/ae79527514c64ef08a1fe960594d044c/c/cc457469761e4cfcb683f0cdb2a3f6d7","dateFriendly":"January 23, 2010 at 20:11"},{"date":"2010-01-24T00:33:16Z","body":"Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against torrents. But if you choose not to support the most common means (which in this case would be HTTP), then you're turning away those who don't want to bother to find and install a torrent application, those who are behind firewalls or such mechanisms that filter torrents, and so on. I have nothing against some people (like, for instance, the great netlabel @enoughrec ) having their releases *also* in torrent (they use &quot;legaltorrents&quot;) - in fact I think it is great that they *also* have their stuff torrent'ed. But it shouldn't be the *only* way, not even the *primary* way. Slappy Line there ends up giving me reason: he gives Canonical as an example, and so I give it to: after going to ubuntu.com I press two clicks and have the ISO being downloaded. Yes, they also have the torrent option, and it is great and useful and important.
