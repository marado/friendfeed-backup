But then I thought... this is quite like cheating, isn't it? Why did I do it? Laziness perhaps? Reminds me of the first time I heard about sudoku, I just wrote a &quot;sudoku solver&quot; in Prolog instead of trying to solve it by myself, and, of course, after having the solver, I started solving them by myself anyway :-P","commands":["edit","delete"],"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"id":"e/3ae6b85b940a470faff737b837c29957/c/b713ee8bdf6a4aeaa0e34394405e959d","dateFriendly":"January 29, 2011 at 22:23"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-01-29T21:08:50Z","from":{"commands":["subscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"dextro","name":"dextro"},"dateFriendly":"January 29, 2011 at 21:08"}],"date":"2011-01-29T20:59:41Z","id":"e/3ae6b85b940a470faff737b837c29957","name":"3ae6b85b","dateFriendly":"January 29, 2011 at 20:59"}
