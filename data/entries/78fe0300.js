The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation with unimproved Wilson fermion discretization and investigate potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g-2 and the current differences between determinations of alpha, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, b^(-1) &gt;~ 10^(11) GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2012-10-11T09:23:59Z","id":"e/78fe030070a147899579a6c20059dcf1/c/7ce182aa289e47e8b2a9934ebd3846d2","dateFriendly":"October 11, 2012 at 09:23"}],"date":"2012-10-11T09:23:59Z","id":"e/78fe030070a147899579a6c20059dcf1","name":"78fe0300","dateFriendly":"October 11, 2012 at 09:23","likes":[]}
