Scope of Requirement for open platforms for devices and applications. 700 MHz C Block licensees subject to this requirement will not be allowed to disable features or functionality in handsets, such as ``locking'' handsets to prevent their transfer from one system to another, where such action is not related to reasonable network management and protection, or compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, 700 MHz C Block licensees may not establish network standards that block Wi-Fi access, MP3 playback ringtone capability, or other services that compete with wireless service providers' own offerings. Standards for third-party applications or devices that are more stringent than those used by the provider itself would likewise be prohibited. In addition, 700 MHz C Block licensees cannot exclude applications or devices solely on the basis that such applications or devices would unreasonably increase bandwidth demands. The Commission emphasizes that 700 MHz C Block licensees may not impose any discriminatory charges (one-time or recurring) or conditions on customers who seek to use devices or applications outside of those provided by the licensee. Further, 700 MHz C Block licensees may not deny access to a customer's device solely because that device makes use of other wireless spectrum bands, such as cellular or PCS spectrum. However, in accepting a multi-band device on its network, a 700 MHz C Block licensee is not required to extend the requirement for open platforms for devices and applications to other spectrum bands on which the provider operates. 35. Reasonable network requirements permitted. The Commission emphasizes that it is not requiring wireless service providers to allow the unrestricted use of any devices or applications on their networks. Wireless service providers may continue to use their own certification standards and processes to approve use of devices and applications on their networks so long as those standards are confined to reasonable network management. For example, providers are free to choose their air interface technology, and to deny service to devices or applications that cannot operate on the same technology, and may restrict particular non-carrier devices and applications on their networks, specifically to ensure the safety and integrity of their networks. In particular, it is reasonable for wireless service providers to maintain network control features that permit dynamic management of network operations, including the management of devices operating on the network, and to restrict use of the network to devices compatible with these network control features. Standards to ensure that network performance will not be significantly degraded would also be appropriate.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-03-29T16:43:18Z","id":"e/3cea3161bc304b66a18a8bb2cf43919a/c/d6dbe27b8af04211a4d0e6db94990d35","dateFriendly":"March 29, 2011 at 16:43"}],"date":"2011-03-29T16:43:18Z","id":"e/3cea3161bc304b66a18a8bb2cf43919a","name":"3cea3161","dateFriendly":"March 29, 2011 at 16:43","likes":[]}
