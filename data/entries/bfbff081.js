Private copying levies are special taxes or levies which are charged on purchases of recordable media and copying devices and then redistributed to the right holders by means of collecting societies. The point of what we can learn from private copy has been largely discuss during COMMUNIA proceedings, especially by Mark Cole at the 7th COMMUNIA Workshop.[78] Applying the flat-rate model to the online exchange of digital files would only port a traditional tool from the analog to the digital environment. The rational for implementing a flat rate model online would be very similar to the reasoning that led many European countries to set up private copies levies. As levies on recording devices and media have been set up upon the acknowledgment that private copying cannot be prevented, the same should apply to the introduction of the legal permission to copy and make available published copyrighted works by individuals for non-commercial purposes in the Internet. Sharing deeply characterizes a preponderant part of online interactions. Lawmakers should acknowledge that an entire culture of sharing cannot be criminalized or prevented. Therefore, online sharing should be legalized, while ensuring fair remuneration to creators. This can be done by the implementation of alternative remuneration systems, especially flat rate models.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2012-09-16T23:00:13Z","id":"e/bfbff081be454f2c82760a8d9567a60e/c/e9a2dbb993114765a7923ea097f99f5b","dateFriendly":"September 16, 2012 at 23:00"}],"date":"2012-09-16T23:00:13Z","id":"e/bfbff081be454f2c82760a8d9567a60e","name":"bfbff081","dateFriendly":"September 16, 2012 at 23:00","likes":[]}
