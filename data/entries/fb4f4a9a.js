The Zoom H1 doesn't have fancy 4-channel recording schemes or a triple-capsule mic; it's merely a twin X/Y stereo recorder that does 24-bit / 96-kHz audio at an unheard-of $99 price. With a reported 10 hours of battery life on a single AA cell, up to 32GB of removable microSDHC storage and loads of physical controls, it already feels like an obvious choice for students, journalists and the like, but of course all that's just on paper -- we'll be waiting till its July 30th debut to hear if the unit performs as positively in real life.
