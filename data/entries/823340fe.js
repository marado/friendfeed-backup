This album features all the traditional elements of the band with an increased level of musical maturity. Each track is majestically composed and every detail claims for attention. We had to listen to this release over 20 times before we could even make up our minds on how to express the beauty hidden in each of the 12 tracks in this release. If you are a fan of Tenhi and/or dark neo-folk music, you will immediately fall in love with this amazing album.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2011-10-27T11:22:17Z","id":"e/823340fe531544dfa8b6126488653209/c/830b4ac232a74ebf80fb431a8b40eca4","dateFriendly":"October 27, 2011 at 11:22"}],"likes":[{"date":"2011-10-27T13:01:20Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"paulasimoes","name":"paula simoes ☃"},"dateFriendly":"October 27, 2011 at 13:01"}],"date":"2011-10-27T11:22:17Z","id":"e/823340fe531544dfa8b6126488653209","name":"823340fe","dateFriendly":"October 27, 2011 at 11:22"}
