They offer a 250 million â‚¬ package consisting of a few big labels they inherited in the EMI buy-out: Virgin, Chrysalis, Parlophone but also... Mute which Daniel Miller sold to EMI when he joined them in 2002 (to recuperate it when he quit them in 2010). In the process some bands had somehow to stay at EMI, such as Depeche Mode and Goldfrapp). Daniel Miller apparently has welcomed the offer and other indies chiefs have joined in too: Richard Branson who wants its Virgin back, but also Kenny Gates (PIAS) or Bell from Domino Records (Artic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand, etc.). Martin Mills (the legendary 4AD label) from Beggars is not happy at all with the offer and he is rather vocal about it. Things aren't going to be easy at Indie Label Summer Camp.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2012-07-24T09:17:59Z","id":"e/0416de5d69f34e14954d0b34dc4037cb/c/56a0fe66c79c4371aa0e422af031c632","dateFriendly":"July 24, 2012 at 09:17"}],"likes":[{"date":"2012-07-24T21:34:06Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"brunomiguel","name":"Bruno Miguel"},"dateFriendly":"July 24, 2012 at 21:34"},{"date":"2012-07-24T21:01:07Z","from":{"commands":["unsubscribe","dm"],"type":"user","id":"canau","name":"Carlos Canau"},"dateFriendly":"July 24, 2012 at 21:01"}],"date":"2012-07-24T09:17:59Z","id":"e/0416de5d69f34e14954d0b34dc4037cb","name":"0416de5d","dateFriendly":"July 24, 2012 at 09:17"}
