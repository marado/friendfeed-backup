To understand how it affects the lives of people, we must listen to their voices.  Fair Play is a global competition for original songs by young bands (18-35 years) on the theme of anti-corruption. Bands are invited to enter the 3rd edition by submitting their anti-corruption music videos online from 24 April to 24 July 2012. The 3 winning bands will win a trip to Brazil to participate in the 3rd GYAC Voices Against Corruption Forum and perform live in Brasilia!  Fair Play is an awareness-raising program and network building effort to connect socially conscious artists and citizens worldwide, brought to you by the JMI Foundation, the World Bank Institute and the Global Youth Anti-Corruption Youth Network.&quot;","commands":["edit","delete"],"via":{"url":"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet","name":"Bookmarklet"},"from":{"commands":["post","dm"],"type":"user","name":"Marcos Marado","id":"mindboosternoori"},"date":"2012-07-02T10:39:16Z","id":"e/f73220e5ca384971890e3e664318f5b1/c/c53a0957e9cb4332903e34794d0956dd","dateFriendly":"July 02, 2012 at 10:39"}],"date":"2012-07-02T10:39:16Z","id":"e/f73220e5ca384971890e3e664318f5b1","name":"f73220e5","dateFriendly":"July 02, 2012 at 10:39","likes":[]}
