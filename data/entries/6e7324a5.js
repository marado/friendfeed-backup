I was feeling a little defensive because a couple of people out there have attacked other portions of our TOS, when we made a concerted effort to make it friendly and reasonable for artists and other users of Uvumi.com.  The fact that we provide an automated method of closing user accounts and revoking the license that you grant to Uvumi when you register for the service is already leaps and bounds beyond nearly every other digital music service out there: &quot;Your grant of such rights is revocable at any time and such revocation shall not in any way require the consent of Uvumi LLC.&quot;","commands":["delete"],"from":{"commands":["subscribe"],"type":"user","id":"marshallatx","name":"Marshall Stokes"},"id":"e/6e7324a5bfaa41c3bf61605bda3ed644/c/ae762a9307924555b3e465751bfa080a","dateFriendly":"February 15, 2010 at 17:41"},{"date":"2010-02-15T17:45:37Z","body":"As for the portion that you singled out in your comments above, I'm not really sure how to get around that issue.  It is very possible that we may need to change the terms of servive in the future, as this is not uncommon in the fast-changing world of digital content.  For example, to improve the license for users, or to include a new aspect of the service which must be described in the TOS, how could we possibly do that if we didn't have a clause to allow us to alter the terms?  We would have to force everyone to re-accept the agreement each time we make a change, which would mean denying access to the service until each and every member has agreed to the changes.  This is highly unusual and there are almost no websites out there that operate this way.  So my question to you is, What do you suggest we change in our license?  Are you aware of any reasonable way around the clause that you are displeased with?  I sincerely hope you can understand that there are few options to get around that issue, and that overall, Uvumi's license agreement is extremely user- and artist-friendly and really does give the artists control over the license and over their content.","commands":["delete"],"from":{"commands":["subscribe"],"type":"user","id":"marshallatx","name":"Marshall Stokes"},"id":"e/6e7324a5bfaa41c3bf61605bda3ed644/c/1103a1d972cb4362936da4a302116a14","dateFriendly":"February 15, 2010 at 17:45"},{"body":"If you change the TOS and I am automaticly agreeing with that, without knowing, then I am agreeing with everything you might want to change it to, which is simply not acceptable.
